# Event detection in social media: An analysis of Tweets from the Turkish Gezi Park Uprising

This is the code repository for my masters thesis, in which I applied a hierarchical clustering method to over 2 million Tweets from the Turkish Gezi Park Uprising. 

The goal was to find out whether major incidents that took place during the first 13 days of the riots could be detected with this method.

Events are defined as "something that happens in a specific time and place with consequences" (Allan, 2012), eg. thousands joining a protest march across the bosphorus bridge, or a protester getting hit by an armored police truck.

### Results:

65 % of pre-selected major events were detected with a clear match and 23 % with a weak match.

On two riot days 88 % of the produced clusters contained relevant information that could be linked to events reported in the media; on 9 of 13 days this rate was above 50 %. 

### Abstract:

This paper takes an explorative approach to determine to which degree events that occur within in the context of a political uprising can be detected from social media posts with computational methods. This is based on two pillars: A comparison of systems and approaches that have been developed in previous research of this topic, and the application of a selected hierarchical clustering method to the case of the Turkish Gezi Park Uprising. The combined learning from these two steps is critically assessed, showing that event detection in the context of a political uprising is feasible, and that such a system can be used for situational awareness. Clustering methods are the most suitable choice for the detection of events by previously unknown categories. Combined applications of clustering and classification are highly suitable for the practical purpose of detecting events by known categories, whereas graph-based methods offer a more versatile approach for specific applications. On the use-cases side, intelligence services and humanitarian agencies are found to have an interest in event detection methods, which holds ethical implications for the deployment of such a system.
